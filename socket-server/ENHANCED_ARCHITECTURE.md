# Enhanced WebSocket Architecture for GroupLoop Device Management

## Problem Solved

The original architecture had a critical flaw: **all devices received all commands**, which was inefficient and could cause confusion. The new architecture implements proper device-specific command routing through the WebSocket server.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. **Device-Specific Command Routing**
- Each device maintains its own WebSocket connection to the server
- Commands are routed only to the target device(s)
- Server acts as a smart router/relay
- No unnecessary network traffic or processing

### 2. **Connection Types**
The server now handles two distinct connection types:

#### **Device Connections** (Scanners, Beacons)
- Send device identification on connection
- Publish sensor data (IMU, beacon RSSI)
- Receive targeted commands
- Maintain connection health with ping/pong

#### **Web Client Connections** (Dashboards, Control Panels)
- Receive real-time device data
- Send commands to specific devices or broadcast to all
- Get device list and status updates
- Visualize system state

## Enhanced Server Features

### **DeviceManager Class**
```python
class DeviceManager:
    - devices: Dict[str, DeviceInfo]  # Track all connected devices
    - web_clients: Set[WebSocketServerProtocol]  # Track web clients
    - device_data_history: Dict[str, List[DeviceData]]  # Store data history
```

### **Key Methods**
- `register_device()` - Register new device connections
- `send_command_to_device()` - Send command to specific device
- `broadcast_to_all_devices()` - Broadcast to all devices
- `update_device_data()` - Store and relay device data
- `add_web_client()` - Manage web client connections

### **Message Types**

#### **Device Messages**
```json
// Device identification
{
  "type": "device_identification",
  "deviceId": "Scanner_AABBCCDDEEFF",
  "deviceType": "scanner",
  "capabilities": ["imu", "ble_scanning", "led_control", "vibration_control"]
}

// Device data
{
  "type": "device_data",
  "deviceId": "Scanner_AABBCCDDEEFF",
  "timestamp": 1234567890,
  "imu": {"x": 0.1, "y": -0.2, "z": 0.9},
  "beacons": {"ne": -45, "nw": -52, "se": -38, "sw": -41}
}
```

#### **Web Client Messages**
```json
// Command to specific device
{
  "type": "command",
  "targetDevice": "Scanner_AABBCCDDEEFF",
  "commandType": "led",
  "commandData": {
    "behavior": "pulse",
    "color": "#FF0000",
    "duration": 5000
  }
}

// Broadcast command
{
  "type": "command",
  "targetDevice": "all",
  "commandType": "vibration",
  "commandData": {
    "pattern": "pulse",
    "intensity": 0.8,
    "duration": 3000
  }
}
```

## Enhanced Client Features

### **DeviceManagerClient Class**
- Automatic reconnection with retry logic
- Device list management
- Real-time data handling
- Command sending capabilities

### **DeviceControlUI Class**
- Visual device management interface
- Individual device controls
- Broadcast controls for all devices
- Real-time data visualization

## Benefits of New Architecture

### 1. **Efficiency**
- Commands sent only to target devices
- Reduced network traffic
- Lower processing overhead
- Better scalability

### 2. **Reliability**
- Device-specific connection management
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Connection health monitoring
- Error isolation

### 3. **Flexibility**
- Support for both targeted and broadcast commands
- Extensible command system
- Multiple web client support
- Device capability reporting

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Structured message formats
- Comprehensive logging
- Easy debugging

## Usage Examples

### **Send LED Command to Specific Device**
```javascript
client.sendLEDCommand('Scanner_AABBCCDDEEFF', 'pulse', '#FF0000', 5000);
```

### **Broadcast Vibration to All Devices**
```javascript
client.broadcastVibrationCommand('pulse', 0.8, 3000);
```

### **Get Device List**
```javascript
const devices = client.getDevices();
console.log(`Connected devices: ${devices.length}`);
```

## Migration Guide

### **To Use Enhanced Server**
1. Replace `app.py` with `enhanced_app.py`
2. Update WebSocket URL in firmware configuration
3. Use enhanced client for device management

### **To Use Enhanced Client**
1. Open `enhanced_index.html` in browser
2. Connect to WebSocket server
3. Use device controls and broadcast features

This architecture provides a robust, scalable foundation for managing multiple BLE scanning devices with efficient command routing and real-time data visualization.
